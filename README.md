# Shark-Attack-Analysis

### Project Overview
Dive into the depths of data as we embark on an analytical expedition to explore the patterns and trends of shark attacks worldwide. This project aims to surface the hidden currents of information that flow beneath the statistics of marine encounters. By charting the data's unexplored territories, we will seek to understand the frequency, distribution, and potential causes of shark attacks.

Equipped with Power BI analytical capabilitiesm my analysis will navigate through a sea of data points. I will meticulously process, analyze, and visualize the information to bring clarity to the murky waters of shark-related incidents.

My investigative journey will cover:

  1. Incident Analysis: Examining the global distribution and temporal trends of shark attacks.
  2. Species-Specific Trends: Identifying which shark species are most commonly involved in incidents.
  3. Human Factors: Understanding the activities and behaviors that correlate with higher incidences of attacks.
   

My objective is to deliver a comprehensive analysis that not only informs but also aids in the development of strategies to reduce the risk of shark attacks while respecting the natural marine ecosystem. By the conclusion of this project, we aim to provide a data-driven perspective that balances human interests with the conservation of these misunderstood marine predators.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following task
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling duplicate and missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Analysis and Visualization

### Results and Findings
1.	USA accounted for 50.48% of Total Number of Shark Attack.
2.	Total Number of Shark Attack was highest for USA at 2143, followed by AUSTRALIA and SOUTH AFRICA. USA accounted for 35.93% of Total Number of Shark Attack. Across all 189 Country, Total Number of Shark Attack ranged from 1 to 2143.
3.	Total Number of Shark Attack was highest for Surfing at 934, followed by Swimming and Fishing. Surfing accounted for 15.66% of Total Number of Shark Attack.
4.	Number of shark attack not leading to death 4324, and fatality at 1508 
5.	  At 654, White Shark had the highest Total Number of Shark Attack and was 278.03% higher than Bull Shark, which had the lowest Total Number of Shark Attack at 173. White Shark accounted for 59.24% of Total Number of Shark Attack. White Shark had the highest Total Number of Shark Attack at 654, followed by Tiger Shark at 277 and Bull Shark at 173.
6.	Total Number of Shark Attack trended up, resulting in a 315.38% increase between 1900 and 2017. Total Number of Shark Attack started trending up on 1996, rising by 109.84% (67) in 20 years.  Total Number of Shark Attack jumped from 61 to 128 during its steepest incline between 1996 and 2016.
7.	Male had the highest Total Number of Shark Attack at 4803, followed by Female at 593 and Unknown at 566. Male accounted for 80.56% of Total Number of Shark Attack.  
8.	At 1464, Afternoon had the highest Total Number of Shark Attack and was 577.78% higher than Night, which had the lowest Total Number of Shark Attack at 216. Afternoon had the highest Total Number of Shark Attack at 1464, followed by Morning at 887 and Night at 216.


### Recomendations
1.	Since the USA has the highest number of shark attacks, implement educational campaigns focused on shark safety and awareness, particularly in high-traffic beach areas.
2.	Enhance surveillance and monitoring systems on beaches with the highest incidents to provide timely warnings to surfers and swimmers.
3.	Collaborate with international bodies to establish and share best practices for shark attack prevention, given the global range of incidents.
4.	Consider the development of international safety standards for water activities in shark-prone areas.
5.	For activities like surfing, swimming, and fishing which have the highest number of shark attacks, develop and promote specific safety guidelines.
6.	Encourage the use of shark deterrent technologies for these activities where feasible.
7.	Analyse the circumstances of shark attacks not leading to death versus those that are fatal to understand the factors that influence survival.
8.	Use this analysis to inform emergency response protocols and medical training for beach lifeguards and first responders.
9.	Focus research efforts on understanding the behaviour of White Sharks, which have the highest number of attacks, to inform prevention strategies.
10.	Educate the public on the behaviour of different shark species, especially White, Tiger, and Bull sharks, to reduce the likelihood of negative encounters.
11.	Given the significant increase in shark attacks since 1996, it would be prudent to increase public awareness about shark safety. This could include educational campaigns on how to avoid shark encounters and what to do in the event of an attack.
12.	Since males account for the majority of shark attack victims, targeted information and safety campaigns could be directed at this group, especially those engaging in activities that increase the risk of shark encounters.
13.	With the afternoon being the peak time for shark attacks, beachgoers could be advised to be extra cautious during these hours. Local authorities might consider increasing lifeguard patrols and surveillance during the afternoon.
14.	Investment in the development and deployment of shark deterrent technologies could be beneficial, especially in areas with high numbers of shark attacks.
15.	Establishing support systems for shark attack victims, including medical, psychological, and financial support, can help individuals recover from such traumatic events.
